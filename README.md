## Introduction

PulseField™ divides parallel PRNG sequences.

In further detail, PulseField™ enables non-colliding parallel PRNG states (and a minimum period) for hyper-efficient PRNGs (such as [BlastCircuit™](https://github.com/ghostproxies/blastcircuit) and [RecoilFuse™](https://github.com/ghostproxies/recoilfuse)).

## Reference

The following algorithm demonstrates an iterative PulseField™ procedure in C.

``` c
a = ROTATE_LEFT(a, CIRCULAR_SHIFT) ^ b;
b += ODD_INCREASE;
```

Both `a` and `b` must have a matching bits length of `BITS_LENGTH` (or `ⁿ`) as a power of 2 that's a supported data type length greater than or equal to `8`.

`b` must wrap around `BITS_LENGTH` bits.

Each instance within a set of parallel PRNG instances that use PulseField™ must adhere to the following 4 seeding requirements before generating parallel PRNG sequences.

- `CIRCULAR_SHIFT` must be an integer (greater than `0` and less than `BITS_LENGTH`) that's consistent among the set of parallel instances.
- `ODD_INCREASE` must be an odd-numbered integer (greater than `0` and less than `2ⁿ`) that's consistent among the set of parallel instances.
- `a` must be an integer (greater than or equal to `0` and less than or equal to `2ⁿ`) that's unique among the set of parallel instances.
- `b` must be an integer (greater than or equal to `0` and less than or equal to `2ⁿ`) that's consistent among the set of parallel instances.

PulseField™ can generate up to 2ⁿ parallel instances that each avoid full state collisions (for at least 2ⁿ output results) among the set of parallel instances.

For example, the following PulseField™ seed values are valid for a set of 3 parallel PRNG instances.

```
a: 0
b: 0

a: 1
b: 0

a: 2
b: 0
```

Furthermore, jumping an arbitrary number of steps is redundant in application-specific cases that require full sequence reproducibility, so PulseField™ is an efficient substitute for jump functions.

After seeding a set of parallel PRNG instances that use PulseField™, assigning a value (outside of an iterative PulseField™ procedure) to `a`, `b`, `CIRCULAR_SHIFT` or `ODD_INCREASE` may void the aforementioned parallelism properties.

After each iterative PulseField™ procedure (depending on the specific PRNG implementation requirements), `a` should either be output directly or mixed into additional state (excluding `b`) that affects the PRNG output.

When `a` is output directly, distancing each `a` seed value (for example, `0` `111` `222` instead of `0` `1` `2`) can reduce parallel sequence correlations among the set of parallel instances.

When `a` is mixed into additional state (excluding `b`), skipping the first several PRNG output results from each parallel instance can reduce parallel sequence correlations among the set of parallel instances.

[pulsefield.c](pulsefield.c) is a PulseField™ validation (when `BITS_LENGTH` is `8` and the `stdint.h` header defines an 8-bit, unsigned integral type for `uint8_t`).
